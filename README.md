## Assignment #1 
___

This early assignment graded on correct structure and styling of tables, as well as use of buttons and links.  

**HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** were employed.  

Additional navigation features and changing button options have also been implemented which are additional to the core assignment requirements.  
Additional time spent on CSS has allowed for a more user presentable format, such as use of colours, borders, button styling, center positioning and early-stage accessibility.
